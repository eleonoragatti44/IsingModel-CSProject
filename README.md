# Ising Model

Complex Systems' project. The course was delivered by the University of Coimbra in the academic year 2020-21 and helded by prof. [Ernesto Costa](https://ernesto.dei.uc.pt/)

## Description

Inthispaperwestudythebehaviourofthewellknown“Ising Model” on a 2D lattice in its exact form and in the approximation of mean field theory. We look for phase transition and dynamical points of interest in the system, considering different parameters. The system is evolved trough Metropolis and Wolff algorithms, and we compared the numerical simulation with the analytical solution given by the exact Hamiltonian and the approximated one given by the mean field theory.
